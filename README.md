# BOOK STARS

Project for Natural Language Processing classes on Computer Science at Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznan. The idea of the project is to teach machine to star rate a book by given review. I am using Beautiful Soup tool to scrap data from website https://lubimyczytac.pl/. For machine learning I am using linear regression technique with Vowpal Wabbit library. Program is written in Python language, it covers following natural language processing problems:
- tokenization, 
- lemmatization, 
- stop words, 
- TFIDF, TODO.

Please note that the program works for Polish opinions.
